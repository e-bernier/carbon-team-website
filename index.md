<section id="OUR GOAL">
    <h1>OUR GOAL</h1>
    <p>At the Carbon Team, we develop a prototype able to capture CO2 with <strong>cheap material</strong> and <strong>low energy</strong> so that the process can be easily scaled up!

    </div>
    <p>But we also research ways to <strong>reuse</strong> or permanently <strong>store</strong> CO2 underground

<section id="OUR TECHNOLOGY">
    <h1>OUR TECHNOLOGY</h1>
    <p> Our prototype consists of three parts : Astérix, Pneumatix and Idéfix.<br>
    <br><strong>Astérix</strong> contains <strong>adsorbants</strong> and works with a periodic air flow. It releases two air fluxes, one rich in CO2 and one poor in CO2 (since it has been removed) thanks to filtration via the adsorbants.
    <br>
    <br><strong>Idéfix</strong> works continously as it contains <strong>graphene membranes</strong> that act like a 
    <br>filter trapping CO2 from the incoming air.
    <br>
    <br><strong>Pneumatix</strong> connects both other parts whose combination allows for this CO2 capture process <strong>optimisation</strong>. </p>

<section id="THE TEAM">
    <h1>THE TEAM</h1>
    <p>We are composed of 60 motivated students who are convinced that we can use what we learn in class to fight against <strong>climate change</strong></p>
