    <p><strong>Ever wonder how we can trap CO₂ out of thin air — and then let it go on command?</strong>
    At the Carbon Team, we’re working with smart materials called adsorbents that do just that. Paired with a process called TSA (temperature swing adsorption), they help us capture and reuse CO₂.</p> <p><a href="{{ '/news/adsorbants' | relative_url }}">Read the full article here</a></p>

    <p><strong>What if a material thinner than anything you can see could help fight climate change?</strong>
