    <p class="article-text"> <strong>At the Carbon Team, adsorbents play a crucial role and are a topic of ongoing research in our partner laboratories. Combined with temperature swing adsorption (TSA), they can separate and capture gasses - in our case CO2.</strong>
    <br><br>Adsorbents are materials designed to attract and hold gases on their surface. Think of adsorbents as special sponges designed to trap CO₂. Just like sponges have pores to hold water, adsorbents have tiny pores that capture CO₂ molecules. But there's a twist: adsobants doesn't just hold the CO₂ forever, they can release it when needed, making them reusable for multiple cycles.
    <br><br>The TSA process can be broken up into two main stages:
    <br>1) Adsorption Phase: During this phase, the adsorbent captures CO₂ from a gas stream. The adsorbent material is kept at a room temperature, which makes it easier for CO₂ molecules to stick to its surface.
    <br>2) Desorption Phase: Once the adsorbent reaches equilbrium loading of CO₂, the system heats it up. The higher temperature shifts this equilibrium, causing the CO₂ molecules to be released and freeing the adsorbent for reuse. The released CO₂ can then be collected, stored or used for other purposes.
    <br><br>New adsorbants are being disovered and perfected every day to optimize key components. This quest is about finding a balance between critical paramters. The ideal adsorbant should of course have great adsoption capacity and high selectivity (targeting only CO₂ molecules). However, its thermal stability, moisture tolerance and cost of regeneration are just as important factors. Three adsorbants have already proven their efficiency:
    <br><br>• Zeolites are crystalline, porous materials with precise pore sizes that selectively trap CO₂ molecules, making them ideal for high-concentration CO₂ capture in industrial settings.
    <br>• Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are highly tunable materials with massive internal surface areas, offering exceptional CO₂ capture capacity and selectivity, especially in advanced technologies.
    <br>• Activated Carbon is a versatile, porous material derived from organic sources known for its high surface area and ability to work effectively in humid and variating temperature conditions.
    <br><br>Adsorbents are vital tools at the Carbon Team for tackling climate change. By selectively capturing CO₂ through adsorption and using thermal energy to release it, these systems offer a smart and sustainable way to manage carbon emissions.
