<section id="OUR GOAL">
    <h1>OUR GOAL</h1>
    <p>At the Carbon Team, we develop a prototype able to capture CO2 with cheap <br>material and low energy so that the process can be easily scaled up!

    <p>But we also research ways to reuse or permanently store CO2 underground

<section id="OUR TECHNOLOGY">
    <h1>OUR TECHNOLOGY</h1>
    <p> Our prototype consists of three parts : Astérix, Pneumatix and Idéfix.<br>
    <br>Astérix contains adsorbants and works with a periodic air flow. It releases two 
    <br>air fluxes : one rich in CO2 and one poor in CO2 (since it has been removed) 
    <br>thanks to filtration via the adsorbants.
    <br>
    <br>Idéfix works continously as it contains graphene membranes that act like a 
    <br>filter trapping CO2 from the incoming air.
    <br>
    <br>Pneumatix connects both other parts whose combination allows for this CO2 
    <br>capture process optimisation. </p>

    <h1>THE TEAM</h1>
    <p>We are composed of 60 motivated students who are convinced that we can <br>use what we learn in class to fight against climate change</p>
